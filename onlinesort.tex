\section*{Online sorting}
From \texttt{Algorithms and Theory of Computation Handbook}:
\begin{quote}
An algorithm that must process each input in turn, without detailed knowledge
of future inputs.
\end{quote}

Not every online algorithm has an offline counterpart. And often also online
algorithms cannot match the performance of offline algorithms.
But in our scenario we want to create competive, suitable solution - the online
algorithm seems to be great fit.

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Storing in right order each input batch on heap.}
	\item{Taking adventage of algorithm like Insertion Sort}
	\item{Odds algorithm - which can be valueable for defining optimal stopping}
  \item{By combining techniques listed above. }
\end{itemize}
