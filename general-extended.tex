\subsection{Parallelization}
Utilizing power of multi core architecture in this scope is always tempting.
Our basic approach can benefit from multithreaded computing - computing averages
rating of movie and sorting them are solid candidates for being paralyzed.
But parallelization is not solving your concerns like memory constraints - it makes
them even bigger. Each thread is a drawback. We can achieve speedup but it takes more
memory. For large datasets it might even be impossible to perform it. That's why we
are redirecting our attention to techniques like Streaming and MapReduce.
